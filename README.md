**üìä Analyzing public perception of world leaders on social media platforms by building a dataset of user posts and comments and categorizing them into positive, negative and neutral opinions using sentiment analysis by employing Large Language Models.**

An objective ranking system for world leaders based on sentiment analysis of anonymous Reddit comments using state-of-the-art NLP algorithms.

## üìã Abstract

With the increasing popularity of social media and the number of hours spent on social media growing rapidly, people share their opinion on a wide range of topics and issues. By extracting user comments on top posts about political leaders on Reddit, we rank them based on their likeability using various ML algorithms. 

Machine learning in social media analysis is essential as it's impossible to classify all data manually. Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. We apply NLP algorithms such as Flair, Transformers using PyTorch, NLTK and combine them to get better predictive performance. This research ranks various political leaders with results from multiple NLP algorithms, serving as objective research gathered from completely anonymous users on Reddit.

## üéØ Why Reddit?

**"Give a man a mask and he'll show you his true face"**

- **Complete Anonymity**: Users share genuine opinions without fear of judgment
- **No Popularity Bias**: Unlike Twitter's verified accounts and follower hierarchies  
- **430M+ Active Users**: Larger user base than competitors like Twitter (217M)
- **Unfiltered Discussions**: Extensive daily discussions on various political topics
- **True Public Opinion**: Anonymous platform reveals authentic sentiments
